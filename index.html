    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently working as a senior lecturer (equal to U.S. Associate Professor) in the School of Mathematics, Physics and Computing at University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ), Australia. My major research interests are in Biometrics, Deep Learning. I have authored a number of papers published in high-ranking journals, e.g., IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (impact factor=6.8), Pattern Recognition (impact factor=8.0), IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics (impact factor=12.3), etc. I received my PhD degree in computer science from the University of New South Wales, Australia. I have managed some research projects, e.g., I was the leading investigator of a research grant from Competitive Evaluation Research Agreement (CERA) Program, Defence Science and Technology Group of the Department of Defence, Australia. I have been actively providing services to the research community. Now I am serving as the editor of journal: KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems (SCIE index), and I was a special issue guest editor of journal: Journal of Information Security and Applications. I also served as a TPC member for a number of International Conferences, e.g., SpaCCS 2017, Globecom 2018, Globecom 2019, IEEE-GCC 2019, Globecom2021, 2022, Globecom 2024 CISS.</p>
