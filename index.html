    <h2>About Me</h2>
   <ul>
        <li>I am currently working as a senior lecturer (equal to U.S. Associate Professor) in the School of Mathematics, Physics and Computing at University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ), Australia.</li>
        <li>My major research interests are in Biometrics, Deep Learning. I have authored a number of papers published in high-ranking journals, e.g., IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (impact factor=6.8), Pattern Recognition (impact factor=8.0), IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics (impact factor=12.3), etc.</li>
        <li>I received my PhD degree in computer science from the University of New South Wales, Australia. I have managed some research projects, e.g., I was the leading investigator of a research grant from Competitive Evaluation Research Agreement (CERA) Program, Defence Science and Technology Group of the Department of Defence, Australia. I have been actively providing services to the research community.</li>
        <li>Now I am serving as the editor of journal: KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems (SCIE index), and I was a special issue guest editor of journal: Journal of Information Security and Applications. I also served as a TPC member for a number of International Conferences, e.g., SpaCCS 2017, Globecom 2018, Globecom 2019, IEEE-GCC 2019, Globecom2021, 2022, Globecom 2024 CISS.</li>
